# Blooper Movie Rental

This project was made by (https://github.com/GuillermoRaez)[Guillermo Raez], student at GeeksHubs Academy.

## The project. ðŸ”§

The project itself consisted on creating a Movie Rental website (UI) connected to a database in which the User/Customer is able to access a movie database and select the movies he wants to rent for his own pleasure. Also, we had to generate an Admin who could control at his will, the interactions made by the users on the website.

## Goals

- Home/Principal View 
- User and Admin Login View
- User Register View
- Panel of all the Rents View (User)
- Panel of all the Rents from all the users (Admin)

This is the minimal version product that is required to make, in order to be in the benchmark of the project.

We have made the minimal requisites, but the main job is not done yet.

## Status

- 60% Completed

## Thanks

I would like to dedicate this words to my classmate who have dedicated a part of their time helping each other.
